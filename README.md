# Genetic Algorithm Project
Small project for the "Fundamentals of AI" course at Politecnico di Milano.

## Contents

The project consists of the following files:

- `Report.pdf` (***In italian***): This document provides an overview of the project, explaining the code implemented in `mastermind.cpp` and the concepts of genetic algorithms. It also presents the application by hand of a genetic algorithm to optimize the parameters of `mastermind.cpp`.
- `mastermind.cpp`: This C++ file contains the implementation of the game of Mastermind, which utilizes a genetic algorithm to solve itself. It prints out the number of generations required to find the correct solution.

## Project Scope

The main objective of this project was to gain an understanding of genetic algorithms and their application. The `mastermind.cpp` file serves as a self-solving version of the game of Mastermind, providing the number of generations required for convergence.

In the `report.pdf` file, a genetic algorithm was manually applied to optimize the parameters used in `mastermind.cpp`. This optimization process involved adjusting variables such as the probability of mutation, type of crossover, type of fitness function and so on. The number of generations taken by `mastermind.cpp` served as the fitness function for the genetic algorithm described in the report.
